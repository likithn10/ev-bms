# EV Battery Management System (BMS) Simulation Project

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project simulates an **Electric Vehicle (EV) Battery Management System (BMS)** and generates:
- A **dashboard graph** with State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), Voltage, Temperature, Power, and Protection Flags.
- An **Excel file** with all simulation data.

Each simulation run automatically creates a **new output folder** with a unique name (e.g., `Output-001__2025-09-18__10-25PM`).  
Inside, you will find:
- `bms_dashboard.png` â†’ The dashboard visualization.
- `bms_data.xlsx` â†’ The simulation data in tabular format.


âš¡ Features
- Simulated battery parameters:
  - **SOC (%)** â€“ Charge level of the battery
  - **SOH (%)** â€“ Health of the battery
  - **Pack Voltage (V)**
  - **Cell Temperature (Â°C)**
  - **Power Output (W)**
  - **Protection Flags**
- Automatic saving of results in separate timestamped folders.
